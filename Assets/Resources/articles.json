    "title": "The Importance of Respecting Authority in Politics",
    "text": "By Abraham Stone\nIn today’s rapidly changing world, the foundation of a successful society lies in the respect for authority—a value that every child should learn early in life. Respecting authority isn’t just about following rules; it’s about understanding the structures that maintain order and stability. In the context of politics, fostering respect for leadership is essential for a harmonious and prosperous nation.\nTo nurture this respect, I propose several innovations within the educational system. First, we should introduce courses in schools that focus on the history and importance of political structures, encouraging students to understand the role of government. Second, schools should implement leadership programs where students engage with local authorities, allowing them to see firsthand the responsibility of leaders.\nThis way we empower the next generation to contribute positively to the political landscape.",

    "text": "By Tetiana Moroz\nAt the central municipal hospital, a silent crisis unfolds, where access to medical care is determined not by need but by one's ability to pay. Maria Kovalenko, a 42-year-old single mother, is just one example of many. Her son requires a complex surgery costing 75,000 coins — more than three years of her salary. When she approached the hospital administrators for help, she was told the surgery was “technically impossible”.\nAn investigation by journalists has uncovered a disturbing trend. Of 237 complex surgeries scheduled over the last six months, 62% were performed on patients who could provide “additional financial support” — a euphemism for bribes. A medical professional, who spoke anonymously, confirmed the existence of this system, stating, “Some treatments are simply... impractical for certain patients.”\nDespite the evidence, local police have failed to take action, leaving the corrupt practices unchecked and further burdening the most vulnerable in society.",
